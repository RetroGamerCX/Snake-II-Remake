# snake-ii-remake
this game is a remake of the snake ii game, originally released for nokia phones in the 2000s. i wrote the game in c++ and c.
I created this game in my spare time, I have no other intention than to entertain people. and remember that the game is in Brazilian Portuguese
you can create your own version of the game, but don't forget to give credit to me and rodrigo schio, he helped me to create and publicize the game on his website.
(his website is in brazilian portuguese):
